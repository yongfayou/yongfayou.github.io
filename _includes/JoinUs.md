  <p><strong>Postdoc and Ph.D. Opportunities in Climate-Smart Agriculture at Virginia Tech</strong></p>
  <p>
    I am seeking a Postdoctoral Researcher and a Ph.D. Student to join my research group in the 
    School of Plant and Environmental Sciences at Virginia Tech. Our group is dedicated to advancing 
    climate-smart agriculture (CSA) by monitoring, assessing, and predicting (MAP) agroecosystem 
    dynamics (e.g., crop yield, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and soil organic carbon (SOC)) under 
    various environmental factors, such as climate change, agricultural management practices, rising 
    CO<sub>2</sub> levels, land use change, and disturbances like droughts and heatwaves. Our overarching 
    goal is to develop science-informed, actionable solutions to enhance food security, mitigate climate 
    change, and promote sustainable and resilient agricultural systems. We approach these studies using 
    data-driven systems methods that integrate domain knowledge with process-based agricultural modeling, 
    artificial intelligence (AI), geospatial data science, and big data analytics.
  </p>

  <h3 style="font-size: 18px; color: #2f95de;">Position 1: Postdoctoral Researcher (AI-Driven Climate-Smart Agriculture)</h3>
  <p>
    This position offers an exciting opportunity to leverage cutting-edge technologies, such as AI, 
    agroecosystem modeling, and model-data integration, to advance the implementation of CSA practices. 
    Depending on the postdoc’s interests and expertise, potential research topics include:
  </p>
  <ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 20px; line-height: 1.2; list-style: none;">
    <li style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">Evaluating environmental outcomes (e.g., GHG emissions, SOC sequestration, yield, and nutrient loading) of CSA practices (e.g., cover cropping, biochar application, and reduced tillage).</li>
    <li style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">Optimizing CSA practices tailored to specific environmental conditions to maximize overall benefits.</li>
    <li style="margin: 0; padding: 0;">Short-term predictions of agroecosystem dynamics under different CSA practices to enable proactive interventions.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    The postdoc will have the opportunity to pursue their own research interests in related fields, 
    collaborate with multidisciplinary teams, and engage with stakeholders, including state implementers 
    and farmers.
