# Join Us

## Postdoc and Ph.D. Opportunities in Climate-Smart Agriculture at Virginia Tech

I am seeking a **Postdoctoral Researcher** and a **Ph.D. Student** to join my research group in the School of Plant and Environmental Sciences at Virginia Tech. Our group is dedicated to advancing climate-smart agriculture (CSA) by **monitoring, assessing, and predicting (MAP)** agroecosystem dynamics (e.g., crop yield, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and soil organic carbon (SOC)) under various environmental factors, such as **climate change, agricultural management practices, rising CO2 levels, land use change**, and disturbances like **droughts and heatwaves**. 

Our overarching goal is to develop **science-informed, actionable solutions** to enhance food security, mitigate climate change, and promote sustainable and resilient agricultural systems. We approach these studies using **data-driven systems methods** that integrate domain knowledge with **process-based agricultural modeling, artificial intelligence (AI), geospatial data science, and big data analytics**.

### Position 1: Postdoctoral Researcher (AI-Driven Climate-Smart Agriculture)

This position offers an exciting opportunity to leverage cutting-edge technologies, such as **AI, agroecosystem modeling, and model-data integration**, to advance the implementation of CSA practices.

#### Research Topics:
- Evaluating environmental outcomes (e.g., GHG emissions, SOC sequestration, yield, and nutrient loading) of CSA practices (e.g., cover cropping, biochar application, and reduced tillage).
- Optimizing CSA practices tailored to specific environmental conditions to maximize overall benefits.
- Short-term predictions of agroecosystem dynamics under different CSA practices to enable proactive interventions.

The postdoc will have the opportunity to pursue their own research interests in related fields, collaborate with multidisciplinary teams, and engage with stakeholders, including state implementers and farmers.

#### Required Qualifications:
- Ph.D. in agroecology, Earth and environmental sciences, geography, remote sensing, or a closely related field (within 4 years after completing the PhD).
- Experience in AI research and geospatial data processing.
- Strong programming skills (e.g., Python, R, MATLAB, C++).
- Ability to conduct independent research and effectively disseminate findings.

#### Preferred Qualifications:
- Experience with process-based modeling, data assimilation, and model-data integration.
- Proficiency in handling large datasets, Google Earth Engine, or high-performance computing.

#### Details:
- **Salary**: $55,000 – $62,000 (commensurate with experience).
- **Starting Date**: After August 1, 2025 (flexible).

### Position 2: Ph.D. Student (Agricultural Carbon Systems)

We are seeking a highly motivated and fully funded **Ph.D. student** to join our research group starting in **Fall 2025 or Spring 2026**. This position offers an exciting opportunity to explore innovative solutions to climate-smart agriculture through interdisciplinary research.

The selected candidate will integrate **field experiments, modeling approaches, and advanced analytical tools** (e.g., AI and geospatial analysis) to advance our understanding of **carbon dynamics and environmental sustainability** in agricultural systems. The candidate will have the flexibility to shape their research direction based on their interests and expertise.

#### Potential Areas of Focus:
- Leveraging advanced tools (e.g., modeling and AI) to support precision agriculture.
- Monitoring, assessing, and predicting agroecosystem dynamics (e.g., yield, GHG emissions, SOC).
- Developing and evaluating mitigation and adaptation strategies in agriculture.
- Investigating carbon dynamics, nutrient cycling, and soil health interactions within agroecosystems.

#### Qualifications:
- A Master’s degree in a relevant field, such as agroecology, geography, soil science, Earth and environmental sciences, GIS, remote sensing, agronomy, hydrology, computer science, or a related discipline.
- A strong sense of responsibility, self-motivation, and a willingness to learn new skills and knowledge.
- Proficiency in programming languages (e.g., Python, R, Matlab, C++).
- Experience with machine learning/deep learning and process-based modeling is preferred.
