  <p><strong>Open Postdoc and Ph.D. Positions in Climate-Smart Agriculture at Virginia Tech</strong></p>
  <p>
    I am seeking <strong>a Postdoctoral Researcher</strong> and <strong>a Ph.D. Student</strong> to join my research group in the School of Plant and Environmental Sciences at Virginia Tech. Our research group addresses some of the most pressing challenges facing global agriculture and the environment. We are dedicated to monitoring, assessing, and predicting agroecosystem dynamics (e.g., crop yield, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and soil organic carbon (SOC)) under various influencing factors, such as climate change, agricultural management, rising CO<sub>2</sub> levels, land use changes, and disturbances like droughts and heatwaves. Our mission is to develop science-informed, actionable solutions that enhance food security, mitigate climate change, and promote sustainable and resilient agricultural systems. We employ data-driven systems approaches that integrate domain knowledge with process-based agricultural modeling, artificial intelligence (AI), geospatial data science, and big data analytics.
