<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>
I am an Assistant Professor in the School of Plant and Environmental Sciences at [Virginia Tech](https://spes.vt.edu/faculty-staff/faculty/you-yongfa.html). My research program focuses on understanding, quantifying, and predicting the complex dynamics of agroecosystems in response to environmental challenges such as climate change, land use change, rising CO2 concentrations, nitrogen deposition, and disturbances like droughts and heatwaves. I also investigate how management practices, such as nitrogen fertilization, tillage, irrigation, and cover cropping, influence these systems. By combining process-based agricultural modeling, remote sensing, field observations, and emerging AI techniques, my goal is to develop actionable solutions and decision-support tools that advance sustainable agriculture while addressing critical environmental consequences, including soil degradation, water pollution, yield variability, and greenhouse gas emissions. Through my extension work, I aim to equip farmers, land managers, and other stakeholders with the knowledge and tools to participate in carbon markets and adopt practices that protect natural resources and improve the resilience and profitability of agricultural systems. More information about my research group and ongoing projects can be found on the [Agroecosystem Modeling Lab](https://you-modeling-lab.github.io/) website.
