<h2 style="margin: 60px 0px 10px;">Short Bio</h2>

I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at [Boston College](https://www.bc.edu/bc-web/schools/morrissey/departments/eesc/people/postdocs/Yongfa_You.html), working under the mentorship of Dr. [Hanqin Tian](https://www.bc.edu/content/bc-web/schools/morrissey/departments/eesc/people/faculty-directory/hanqin-tian.html). My research focuses on understanding, quantifying, and predicting the complex dynamics of agroecosystems in response to environmental challenges such as climate change, agricultural management practices (e.g., nitrogen fertilization, tillage, irrigation), rising CO2 concentrations, nitrogen deposition, and disturbances like droughts and heatwaves. My overarching goal is to develop actionable solutions and decision-support tools that enhance climate-resilient and sustainable agricultural systems.

## Research Interest

- **Agriculture** (e.g., soil carbon, greenhouse gases, food security, precision management)
- **Climate Change** (e.g., impacts, mitigation, adaptation, extreme climate events)
- **Earth System Modeling** (e.g., model development, applications, uncertainty analysis)
- **Sustainable Land Management Practices** (e.g., cover cropping, no-tillage, crop rotation)
- **Geospatial Data Science** (e.g., geospatial analysis, remote sensing, GIS, deep learning)
